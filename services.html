                        <p>
                        Web designing is a crucial aspect of creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. It involves the artful arrangement of various design elements such as colors, typography, layout, and imagery to craft a captivating digital experience. The layout of a website determines its structure and organization, while the choice of color scheme sets the mood and creates a cohesive visual identity. Typography plays a vital role in enhancing readability and establishing a hierarchy of information. Incorporating relevant and high-quality imagery enhances the overall aesthetic appeal and helps communicate messages effectively. Responsiveness is essential in ensuring that the website looks and functions seamlessly across different devices. User experience (UX) considerations, such as intuitive navigation and clear calls-to-action, are vital for engaging visitors and achieving desired goals. Accessibility should also be prioritized to ensure inclusivity for all users. Wireframing and prototyping help visualize the design before implementation, allowing for feedback and iterative improvements. By staying updated with design trends and best practices, web designers can create compelling and modern designs that leave a lasting impact on users.</p>
                       <p> Web designing refers to the process of creating the visual aesthetics and layout of a website. It involves the use of various design elements, such as color schemes, typography, imagery, and layout techniques, to create an appealing and user-friendly website. Here are some key aspects of web designing:
                       </p>
                       
                       
                       <ol style="margin-top: 3%;">
                        <li>
                            <p>&#x261E; Layout : The layout determines how the content of a website is structured and organized. It includes the placement of navigation menus, headers, footers, sidebars, and content sections.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>&#x261E; Color Scheme : Choosing an appropriate color scheme is essential for creating a visually appealing and cohesive website. Colors can evoke different emotions and set the overall tone of the website.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                &#x261E; Typography : The selection of fonts, font sizes, and font styles greatly impacts the readability and visual hierarchy of a website. It is important to choose fonts that are easy to read and consistent with the overall design.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                &#x261E; Imagery : Images and graphics play a crucial role in web design. They can enhance the visual appeal of a website, convey messages, and provide a better user experience. It's important to optimize images for web to ensure fast loading times.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                &#x261E; Responsiveness : With the increasing use of mobile devices, it's crucial to design websites that are responsive and adapt well to different screen sizes. Responsive design ensures that the website looks and functions properly on various devices.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                &#x261E; User Experience (UX) : Web design should prioritize the user experience, ensuring that visitors can easily navigate and interact with the website. This involves considering factors such as intuitive navigation, clear calls-to-action, and minimizing load times.
                                Accessibility: Designing websites with accessibility in mind is important to ensure that people with disabilities can access and use the website effectively. This includes considerations like proper color contrast, alt tags for images, and keyboard accessibility.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                &#x261E; Wireframing and Prototyping : Before starting the actual design, it's common to create wireframes and prototypes to visualize the layout, content, and user flow of the website. These help in planning and getting feedback before proceeding to the implementation phase.

                       <p>
                        In 1989, whilst working at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project, which later became known as the World Wide Web. From 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text-only HTML pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode web browser. In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic browser. At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of them were Unix-based and naturally text-heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould. The W3C was created in October 1994 to "lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability." This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a proprietary browser and programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript and other languages. In 1994 Andreessen formed Mosaic Communications Corp. that later became known as Netscape Communications, the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. From 1996 to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and Dynamic HTML. On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace.

                       <p>
                        In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and HTML tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure authoring technique and is today an important aspect of web design. The HTML markup for tables was originally intended for displaying tabular data. However, designers quickly realized the potential of using HTML tables for creating complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible. At this time, as design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good markup structure, little attention was paid to semantics and web accessibility. HTML sites were limited in their design options, even more so with earlier versions of HTML. To create complex designs, many web designers had to use complicated table structures or even use blank spacer .GIF images to stop empty table cells from collapsing. CSS was introduced in December 1996 by the W3C to support presentation and layout. This allowed HTML code to be semantic rather than both semantic and presentational and improved web accessibility, see tableless web design. In 1996, Flash (originally known as FutureSplash) was developed. At the time, the Flash content development tool was relatively simple compared to now, using basic layout and drawing tools, a limited precursor to ActionScript, and a timeline, but it enabled web designers to go beyond the point of HTML, animated GIFs and JavaScript. However, because Flash required a plug-in, many web developers avoided using it for fear of limiting their market share due to lack of compatibility. Instead, designers reverted to GIF animations (if they didn't forego using motion graphics altogether) and JavaScript for widgets. But the benefits of Flash made it popular enough among specific target markets to eventually work its way to the vast majority of browsers, and powerful enough to be used to develop entire sites.
